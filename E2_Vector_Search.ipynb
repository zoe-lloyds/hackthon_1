    "- Semantic search is a type of search that uses the meaning of words and phrases to find relevant results.\n",
    "- In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to do semantic search with embeddings generated from the news text using vector search`\n",
    "- Vertex AI Vector Search (formerly known as Matching Engine) is a vector database, which can find the most similar vectors from over a billion vectors. Matching Engine's ANN service can serve similarity-matching queries at high queries per second (QPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is more appropriate for larger datasets and production deployments. For demonstrating the full workflow and explanation, a small dataset is pre-processed locally and uploaded to a storage bucket in this example. In a larger or production deployment, the embedding generation and storage can be done separately and Vector Search provides db update strategies as described later in this notebook."
