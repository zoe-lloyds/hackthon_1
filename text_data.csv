The card reader display will show ENTER PIN.Step six:Key the PIN for the card you’re using into the card reader and press enter.Step seven:Once you’ve entered your PIN correctly, your card reader will show an eight-digit number – this is your passcode.Key this passcode into the box shown on the Internet Banking screen and press ‘continue’.Step eight:You will now be asked to set up your memorable information.

This is the same password you use to log in to Online for Business.Setting up a new payment recipient or standing orderYou’ll need to use the ‘Respond’ key on your Card Reader, instead of ‘Identify’.This change ensures Online for Business payments remain secure.To generate a passcode using ‘Respond’ please follow the on-screen instructions when making a payment or setting up a new standing order.Insert the card into the Card Reader and press RESPOND.Enter your PIN number and press ‘ENTER’ on card reader.Enter the number displayed on the screen in your Card Reader and press ‘ENTER’.Card Reader will now display an 8 digit passcode to be entered in the payment page to complete the transaction.Audio card readerexpandable sectionIf you have a disability that prevents you from using your card reader, we can supply you with an audio card reader – just call us on0345 300 0116.This works in exactly the same way as a standard card reader but has additional audio functionality. It holds no personal information about you and does not need to be connected to your computer at any time.To activate the audio function, just turn the dial upwards before inserting your card. Audio instructions will guide you through the steps you need to take. The audio reader has built-in speakers or for added security you can use headphones.Your audio card reader will time out and turn off after 90 seconds of inactivity. To reactivate it, simply remove and reinsert your card into the reader.When pressing a key on the audio card reader, always ensure that you hear the voice prompt before pressing another key. Keys pressed during the voice prompts are not recognised by the reader.To repeat a voice prompt, press the 'clear' button.When the audio function is switched off, you can press the '0' key to increase the size of the unique eight-digit code generated by the audio card reader. When the audio function is switched on, press '0' repeatedly to hear the code repeated back to you one number at a time. A single 'beep' will tell you when you reach the end of the code.Frequently asked questionsexpandable section1.Jump toDo I need a card reader to make payments?2.Jump toWhat is the Respond function?3.Jump toWhat should I do if I need a replacement card reader?4.Jump toWhat happens if my card reader is stolen?5.Jump toWhat happens if I don’t have my card reader or it’s not working, and I need to access Online for Business?6.Jump toCan I have more than one card reader?7.Jump toI have a disability that may prevent me from using my card reader, what can I do?8.Jump toWhich cards can I use with my card reader?9.Jump toI have several business accounts, all with business debit cards – which of them do I use?10.Jump toWhat if someone else in the business needs to access the business account online?11.Jump toThe log on screen does not show the right card number.
